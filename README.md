# Social Network API

## Description:
I created the backend API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friends list.  I used Express.js for the routing with a MongoDB database, and Mongoose ODM.  I also utilized Moment.js to format dates/times for the createdAt property where applicable.<br>
